# Wikid: The stupid-simple wiki

Hi there. This document is about *wikid* (pronounce how you like), a really simple [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). This wiki is so simple, in fact, that I hesitate even to call it a wiki. You see, it doesn't use a database, or have authorization or even users. There's no history, no email notifications, no media uploading, no discussions, no metadata and no UI for managing pages.
